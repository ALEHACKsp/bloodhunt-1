# Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt Internal

An internal cheat for Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt that hooks the D3D11 Present Scene to render.

## Problems

I've removed my rendering framework, you can add [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).  
Aswell as my bounding boxes, sorry they're really hard to give up. But I did leave some clues to make your own <3

## Usage

1. Due to the teribble implementation of Easy Anti Cheat EOS, you can use any public kernel injector. ([Face Injector](https://github.com/ALEHACKsp/face-injector-v2-1/tree/main/face_injector_v2))
2.  Compile in `x64 Release` & inject.

## Note

Soon as this starts to get out obviously game developers are going to start enhancing their security but I'd just like to say that this was a really fun project to work on with my friend PF, bye yall!

oh and thank you sm to rice gum for helping me with silent and giving me some exploits, super kewl dude <3
